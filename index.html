						<h3>The US economy recently experienced a recession and recovery</h3>
						<p>According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the US economy fell into the most recent recession in 2007, which ended in 2009.  There were massive increases in unemployment and decreases in consumer spending.</p>
						<h3>Crime rates are related to the economy</h3>
						<p>Studies as far back as the <a href="http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.so.10.080184.000523" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1970s and 80s</a> have shown that there is a relationship between the state of the economy and the occurence of crimes.  Since this time, there have been many <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10940-011-9139-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scientific studies</a> investigating this complex relationship.</p>
						<h3>Explore this relationship in Los Angeles county</h3>
						<p>The relationship between crime and the economy is not linear across the nation, states, or cities.  Using the tools below, learn about crime in LA County between 2010, immediately following the recession, and 2015, after the economy had recovered.  Explore crimes reported to the LA Police Department (LAPD) and compare crime rates in different areas of the county.  Run the crime simulator to simulate crimes in your reporting area and examine heatmaps of crime density.</p>
